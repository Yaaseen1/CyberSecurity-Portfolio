# Altoro Mutual Manual Penetration Test Report

This folder contains a hands-on penetration testing report focused on the **Altoro Mutual demo banking site** ([testfire.net](https://testfire.net)). The site is intentionally vulnerable (and thankfully fake), making it a perfect target for beginners learning the art of ethical hacking — the kind that doesn’t get you arrested.

## 🎯 Purpose

This report was created to guide cybersecurity newcomers through **manual** penetration testing — no automated tools like Burp Suite or SQLMap were used (yet). Everything was tested with just a browser, a terminal, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

If you've ever wanted to pop an alert box or trick a fake bank into transferring fake money, you're in the right place.

## 🕳️ Vulnerabilities Explored

The report covers:
- SQL Injection (classic `' OR '1'='1`)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Session Fixation

Each section includes:
- A simple explanation of the bug
- Manual step-by-step reproduction
- Screenshots or descriptions
- Suggested fixes (because we break things responsibly)

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **OS**: Kali Linux (2023.4)
- **Browser**: Chromium
- **Text Editor**: Mousepad
- **Local Server**: Python 3’s HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`)
- **Test Target**: [Altoro Mutual Demo Site](https://testfire.net)

## ⚠️ Legal (and Common Sense) Disclaimer

This project was conducted in a **safe, legal environment** for **educational purposes only**.  
Please do **not** try these techniques on real websites. You won’t become a hacker — you'll just become a headline.
