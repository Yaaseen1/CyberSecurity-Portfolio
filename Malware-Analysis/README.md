# Malware Analysis Lab Setup

## ðŸ›  Environment:
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Two Virtual Machines:
  - **Windows 10 VM** (for malware execution)
  - **REMnux Linux VM** (for analysis tools)

## ðŸ”’ Network Configuration:
- Host-Only Network Adapter to ensure full isolation
- Disabled Internet access on malware VM
- Internal network communication only (safe testing environment)

## ðŸ§° Tools Installed:
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** (for automated malware analysis)
- **Wireshark** (for packet capturing)
- **PEStudio** (for static analysis)
- **Procmon** (for monitoring system activity)
- **Ghidra** (for reverse engineering)

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:
- Oracle VM setup
- Installed tools
- Network settings

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Lab:
- To safely execute and analyze malware samples
- To learn static and dynamic analysis techniques
- To simulate real-world Blue Team and Red Team scenarios

---

> **Next Steps:** I plan to perform basic malware executions inside this environment and document the behavior captured through Wireshark and Procmon.
