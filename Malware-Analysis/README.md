# Malware Analysis Lab Setup

## ðŸ›  Environment:
- Oracle VirtualBox
- One Virtual Machine:
  - **Windows 10 VM** (for both malware execution and analysis)

## ðŸ”’ Network Configuration:
- Host-Only Network Adapter (no Internet access to malware VM)
- Fully isolated environment for safe malware analysis

## ðŸ§° Tools Installed:
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** (sandbox for automated malware analysis)
- **Wireshark** (to capture and analyze network traffic)
- **PEStudio** (for static malware analysis)
- **Procmon** (for monitoring file, registry, and process activity)
- **Ghidra** (for reverse engineering and deep static analysis)

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:
- VirtualBox with Windows 10 VM running
- Installed analysis tools
- Host-only network settings

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Lab:
- To safely execute suspicious files
- To practice both static and dynamic analysis techniques
- To build skills relevant to malware detection, response, and investigation

---

> **Next Steps:** I plan to analyze basic malware samples by using PEStudio for static properties and Procmon for monitoring behavior during execution.
