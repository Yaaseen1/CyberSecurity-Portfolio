# Malware Analysis Lab Setup

## üõ† Environment:
- Oracle VirtualBox
- One Virtual Machine:
  - **Windows 10 VM** (for both malware execution and analysis)

## üîí Network Configuration:
- Host-Only Network Adapter (no Internet access to malware VM)
- Fully isolated environment for safe malware analysis

## üß∞ Tools Installed:
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** (sandbox for automated malware analysis)
- **Wireshark** (to capture and analyze network traffic)
- **PEStudio** (for static malware analysis)
- **Procmon** (for monitoring file, registry, and process activity)
- **Ghidra** (for reverse engineering and deep static analysis)

## üì∏ Screenshots:
- VirtualBox with Windows 10 VM running
- Installed analysis tools
- Host-only network settings

## üéØ Purpose of Lab:
- To safely execute suspicious files
- To practice both static and dynamic analysis techniques
- To build skills relevant to malware detection, response, and investigation

---

> **Next Steps:** I plan to analyze basic malware samples by using PEStudio for static properties and Procmon for monitoring behavior during execution.


üñºÔ∏è VirtualBox VM Settings
VirtualBox Manager ‚Äì Malware Lab VM Configuration
This shows the virtual machine running Windows 10 for malware analysis. The lab uses Oracle VirtualBox with proper isolation and snapshots enabled for safe experimentation.

üñºÔ∏è Host-Only Network Adapter
Network Isolation Configuration
The malware analysis VM is connected via a Host-Only Adapter to prevent internet access. This ensures malware cannot exfiltrate data or reach external systems.

üñºÔ∏è ipconfig Output
Internal IP Address (Host-Only Network)
The Windows 10 VM receives a local IP address via VirtualBox‚Äôs Host-Only Adapter. This demonstrates that the lab environment is correctly segmented from the internet.

üñºÔ∏è Desktop with Tools Installed
Windows 10 VM with Analysis Tools Installed
Key malware analysis tools like PEStudio, Wireshark, Procmon, and Ghidra are installed and ready for use. This environment will be used for both static and dynamic analysis.

üñºÔ∏è Wireshark Open
Wireshark ‚Äì Network Monitoring Tool Ready
Wireshark is set up in the malware lab. Although no network traffic is captured yet, the tool is ready for dynamic analysis to observe malware behavior and communication patterns.

üñºÔ∏è PEStudio and Procmon
PEStudio and Procmon Launched
Tools like PEStudio and Procmon are configured to inspect static properties and runtime behavior of binaries. This enables detailed insights into suspicious executables.
