# Malware Analysis Lab Project

## 🛠 Lab Setup:
- Virtualization: Oracle VirtualBox
- VMs used:
  - Windows 10 (for malware execution - **isolated network**)
  - REMnux Linux (for static and dynamic analysis tools)
- Network Setup:
  - Host-Only Adapter (to prevent internet leakage)
  - Wireshark for traffic capture
- Tools:
  - Cuckoo Sandbox
  - Wireshark
  - PEStudio
  - Procmon
  - Ghidra (for static analysis)

## 🦠 Malware Sample:
*(For safety reasons, actual malware sample is not uploaded. Only analysis reports and observations are shared.)*

- Sample Type: [e.g., Trojan / Ransomware / Adware sample]
- Source: [e.g., MalwareBazaar, TheZoo, or other public malware repository]

## 🔬 Analysis Performed:
- **Static Analysis:**
  - File structure inspection (PEStudio)
  - Strings analysis
  - Hashes generation (MD5, SHA256)

- **Dynamic Analysis:**
  - Execution behavior in isolated VM
  - Network traffic inspection with Wireshark
  - API calls and file system changes (Procmon)

## 📊 Key Findings:
- Malware attempted to connect to remote IP address: `123.45.67.89`
- Dropped file in `C:\Users\Public\malwarepayload.exe`
- Modified registry key: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

## 📁 Files Attached:
- [Link to your Wireshark PCAP file (optional)] (if you want, you can upload sanitized versions)
- [Screenshots of analysis] (upload images to the repo)
- [PDF or Markdown Report] (a summary report of your findings)
