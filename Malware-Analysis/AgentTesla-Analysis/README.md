# AgentTesla Malware Analysis

This project contains a static and dynamic malware analysis of a real-world AgentTesla sample. The analysis was conducted in an isolated malware lab using tools like PEStudio, dnSpy, Procmon, Regshot, and Wireshark.

🔐 **Focus:** Obfuscation, registry modification, and behavioral monitoring.  
📎 **Note:** No external C2 traffic was observed during dynamic analysis due to host-only network configuration.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **PEStudio** – Static binary inspection
- **dnSpy** – .NET decompilation
- **Procmon** – Runtime registry + file system monitoring
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic observation
- **Regshot** – Before/after registry snapshot comparison

📂 See the [`Tool-Demos/`](./Tool-Demos) folder for screenshots and findings.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Heavy .NET obfuscation using Crypto Obfuscator
- No valid code signing certificate
- Registry tampering observed (via Regshot and Procmon)
- No external network communication (host-only environment or sandbox-aware)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This analysis was done for educational purposes in a safe virtual machine environment. Do not run malware outside a controlled lab.
