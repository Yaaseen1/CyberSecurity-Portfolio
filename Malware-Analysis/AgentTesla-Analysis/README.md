## 🔍 Project Summary
This project combines **static, dynamic, and behavioral malware analysis** with a simulated incident response workflow to detect and investigate AgentTesla malware activity.

- **Static Analysis:**  
  - .NET decompilation with dnSpy  
  - Heavy obfuscation via Crypto Obfuscator  
  - No valid code signing certificate  

- **Dynamic Analysis:**  
  - Executed in Windows 10 VM (host-only network)  
  - Registry modifications detected (Procmon + Regshot)  
  - No external C2 traffic observed  

- **Behavioral Detection:**  
  - Windows Event Logs (`.evtx`) ingested into Splunk  
  - Event ID 4688 used to identify suspicious process creation  
  - Regex field extraction for deeper visibility

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **PEStudio** – Static binary inspection  
- **dnSpy** – .NET decompilation  
- **Procmon** – File & registry monitoring  
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic capture  
- **Regshot** – Registry snapshot comparison  
- **Splunk** – SIEM-based log analysis

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Suspicious EXEs running from `%AppData%` and `%Temp%`  
- Registry tampering for persistence  
- Regex-based field extraction overcame Splunk parsing gaps
